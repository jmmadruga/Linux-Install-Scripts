jubuntu
===============

Have you ever had to install your friendly neibourhood Linux distribution (Ubuntu) over and over again in many computers?

Let's admit it, you will get tired at some point. I now I got. So what could I do to step up a notch?

Inspired in the original script of my respected frind, João Fracassi (https://www.facebook.com/joao.nomad), I have modified it to create my own script with plenty of extra packages that I need to use sometimes.

As I'm egocentrical guy, I decided to name it Jerônimo's Ubuntu, but to simplify it became just "Jubuntu".

It ain't perfect (yet), it has lot's of software, but it's better than using the slow "software center".

So, for those of you interested, download, use, fork, contribute and hack on!
