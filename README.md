Linux Install Scripts (LIS)
===============

Have you ever had to install your friendly neibourhood Linux distribution over and over again in many computers?

Let's admit it, you will get tired at some point. I now I got. So what could I do to step up a notch?

Inspired in the original script of "Ubuntu for Sysadmins" made by my respected friend, João Fracassi (https://www.facebook.com/joao.nomad), I have modified it to create my own script with plenty of extra packages that I need to use sometimes.

As I'm egocentrical guy, I decided to name it Jerônimo's Ubuntu, but to simplify it became just "Jubuntu".

The fun part about this, is that people actually found the idea as a good one, and started making their own versions!

So I have decided to step up a notch once again, and create a bigger project: "Linux Install Scripts".

The objective is to collect many options as we can get of small scripts to make things faster, simpler and effective.

So, for those of you interested, download, use, fork, contribute and hack on!
